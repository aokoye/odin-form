# The OdinProject: Sign-up Form

The goal of this project was to create and style a sign-in form. I found it more enjoyable/easier(?) than other projects in large part because I feel more comfortable with HTML and CSS. 

In the future I'd like to make this responsive which I think should be relatively straight forward.
